# Why

I decided to create a blog because I have some random poems and written prose from my younger days that I am unsure where to share. I don't care if they are good or not. I've
seen many artists (I don't consider myself one) that write, draw, or compose many stuff that they never share. That's ok we all want to share the best we do, and build up confidence. 
However, there's some people who will never share anything they do because they are never satisfied with it. Some of them are really talented and it's a shame. 

In my case, I wrote some stuff when I was younger and I've always been too embarrased to share. Now, I stumbled upon those texts years later so I've decided that I will share them. It 
has been on my mind for very long and I finally have no fear of what people say. I feel like sharing, so I will share them and that's it. If someone enjoys them, so be it, if not, 
that's ok too.
